								<h3>Project: Timecard Automation for Supplier Invoicing</h3>
								<p>In large-scale procurement environments, suppliers submit timecards under Time & Material (T&M) or Fixed Price models. Previously, this was manual—causing invoice delays, compliance issues, and inefficiencies in Oracle SaaS receipt processing.</p>
 <p>We built a VBCS-based app for 50+ suppliers to submit timecards, integrated with ATP and Oracle Cloud via OIC. Key features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>T&M and Fixed Price modes</li>
      <li>PO/BPA validation</li>
      <li>Automated approval workflows</li>
      <li>BI Publisher reports for compliance</li>
    </ul>
		<ul>
      <li>Dynamic UI with validations and fragments in VBCS</li>
      <li>Normalized ATP schema and REST-exposed APIs via ORDS</li>
      <li>OIC integrations for PO sync and receipt creation</li>
      <li>Email notifications with retry-safe queues</li>
      <li>BI Publisher reports for PDF/Excel downloads</li>
    </ul>
		 <ul>
      <li>60% reduction in manual validations</li>
      <li>80% faster processing time</li>
      <li>10,000+ timecards processed annually</li>
      <li>100% contract compliance and audit success</li>
    </ul>						

    <table>
      <tr><th>Challenge</th><th>Resolution</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Varied input formats</td><td>Used dynamic fragments per PO type</td></tr>
      <tr><td>PO validation complexity</td><td>OIC-driven real-time checks</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Timeouts on bulk submissions</td><td>Async queue and retry design in ATP</td></tr>
    </table>


    <ul>
      <li>Fragmented UI design boosts VBCS performance</li>
      <li>ORDS access must be securely gated</li>
      <li>Staging in ATP improves middleware resilience</li>
      <li>BI Publisher is vital for formal documentation</li>
    </ul>


    <ul>
      <li>Mobile version via Visual Builder Mobile</li>

      <li>Supplier Portal extensions</li>
    </ul>


  <h3>Project: Job and Program Management Applications</h3>
    <p>
      The client, a multi-entity global organization, required a centralized platform to manage job numbers and their associated employee and department assignments. The absence of a unified system led to data fragmentation, manual dependency on Excel for mapping, and significant delays in workforce planning and reporting. They also lacked audit visibility for changes made to assignments over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      I designed and built two tightly integrated Oracle VBCS applications: one for Job Management and one for Program Management. These applications provided real-time tracking, editing, and reporting of job and assignment data through seamless interaction with Oracle ATP and REST services via OIC.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for one-to-many relationships (job-to-employee, job-to-department)</li>
      <li>Modular form rendering using dynamic `vb-fragments`</li>
      <li>History tracking and audit trail on all changes</li>
      <li>Bulk insert and update with validation via PL/SQL packages</li>
      <li>Data integration with HCM for employee/department fetch</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed normalized database schema in ATP for job details and assignments</li>
      <li>Created reusable PL/SQL packages for validation, bulk insert, update, and rollback</li>
      <li>Built REST-exposed procedures using ORDS and secured access using role-based control</li>
      <li>Developed dynamic VBCS forms using `oj-for-each`, `oj-collapsible`, and `vb-fragments`</li>
      <li>Implemented audit logic with timestamped change tracking and user metadata</li>
      <li>Created helper UI fragments for people search, auto-fill from HCM, and assignment review</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Enabled centralized control over 5,000+ job records and 15,000+ assignments</li>
      <li>Reduced manual reconciliation time by over 60%</li>
      <li>Improved traceability with 80% enhancement in audit visibility</li>
      <li>Cut onboarding and job role assignment effort from 3 days to 1</li>
    </ul>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Challenge</th><th>Resolution</th></tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Rendering dynamic forms based on assignment count</td>
        <td>Used `oj-for-each` and collapsibles to create fully dynamic UI blocks</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Validating foreign key links in nested assignments</td>
        <td>Used PL/SQL validation packages and error maps for real-time feedback</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Handling bulk operations with rollback logic</td>
        <td>Built transaction-safe PL/SQL packages with EXCEPTION blocks and audit</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <ul>
      <li>Nested dynamic forms in VBCS are manageable using component modularity</li>
      <li>Audit logging is critical in high-change applications and should be schema-level</li>
      <li>HCM integrations require throttling and optimization for REST fetches</li>
      <li>Bulk PL/SQL procedures must be built with idempotent design principles</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Excel/CSV upload support with preview-validation before insert</li>
      <li>Role-based dashboards for department heads to approve assignments</li>
      <li>Job assignment visualization using Oracle JET charts</li>
      <li>Drill-down exportable history view for audit and compliance team</li>
    </ul>
  </details>


  <h3>Project: Oracle Fusion Automation Suite</h3>
    <p>
      The client was undertaking a large-scale Oracle Cloud Fusion implementation across Financials (GL), Project Portfolio Management (PPM), and Supply Chain Management (SCM). Manual testing of business processes was time-consuming and error-prone, often resulting in delayed releases, inconsistent test coverage, and higher defect leakage during UAT. A full automation suite was needed to support regression testing, data validation, and migration efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I led the development and delivery of an end-to-end automation framework using UFT One and ALM to cover over 1,500 test scenarios. Additionally, I designed a custom Angular-based UI that enabled business analysts and QA leads to perform data transformations and validations for pre-UAT cycles. The suite covered:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1500+ automated test scripts across GL, PPM, and SCM modules</li>
      <li>Daily scheduled regression runs with ALM integration</li>
      <li>Reusable components for login, navigation, and transaction validation</li>
      <li>BI Publisher reports for consolidated test results</li>
      <li>Angular UI tool for test data preparation and migration validation</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Defined test automation strategy with Deloitte QA leadership</li>
      <li>Built modular reusable functions for rapid script development</li>
      <li>Created end-to-end workflows for GL Journal Entries, Project Costing, and PO Lifecycle</li>
      <li>Integrated automated scripts with ALM for defect reporting and test cycle tracking</li>
      <li>Developed a custom UI using Angular to allow non-technical users to validate data mappings and initiate test cycles</li>
      <li>Generated BI Publisher reports from ALM and UFT logs for executive reporting</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>70%</strong> reduction in manual testing effort across releases</li>
      <li><strong>50%</strong> faster data transformation and migration validation</li>
      <li>Enabled parallel testing across 3 major Fusion tracks (GL, PPM, SCM)</li>
      <li>Reduced UAT cycle from 4 weeks to 2.5 weeks</li>
      <li>Improved defect detection rates during SIT by over 40%</li>
    </ul>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Challenge</th><th>Resolution</th></tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Repetitive UI navigation slowing down script execution</td>
        <td>Created wrapper functions and conditional checkpoints to skip redundant steps</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>ALM integration complexity</td>
        <td>Built intermediate result logs and APIs to sync test status to ALM</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Data transformation rules varied by module</td>
        <td>Used Angular app to define dynamic mapping rules and reusable formats</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <ul>
      <li>Automation is not just script creation—it’s orchestration, data, and reporting combined</li>
      <li>Custom UI tools improve adoption of test frameworks among business teams</li>
      <li>BI Publisher can be adapted for QA reporting just as effectively as for financials</li>
      <li>Consistency and modularity in UFT scripting reduce maintenance effort significantly</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>CI/CD integration with Oracle Fusion test runs</li>
      <li>End-to-end test data management portal for functional consultants</li>
      <li>AI-driven screenshot validation and OCR-based field matching</li>
      <li>Interactive dashboards using Oracle JET for test coverage insights</li>
    </ul>

								<h3>Internship Experience-1:</h3>
									<p>Teja and a team of five worked on a Computer Vision based case study to increase real-time security using live feed of CCTV cameras of a resort. The team's aim was to develop a real-time security system that would be more efficient than a human security system, more affordable in the long run, and could be deployed easily. The team first analyzed the live feed of the CCTV cameras to identify potential security risks. They then developed a computer vision algorithm that could detect these risks in real time. The team also developed a user interface that would allow security personnel to monitor the system and take action as needed.</p>
